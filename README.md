Collection of my solutions to the laboratory asignments to my Operating Systems class

### Info:
Lab 1 - Linux signals and interrupts, priority interrupts \
Lab 2 - Basic terminal with a few commands + the ability to run code \
Lab 3 - Synchronization using semaphores and mutexes \
Lab 4 - Simple paging simulator \
\
For lab 4 we were told to do whatever, but that we'd need to explain it properly. I chose to simulate random processes starting and requesting a random amount of memory.
